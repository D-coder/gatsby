## Lyrics:

[Verse 1]

>I won't spend my night alone

>Gonna call everyone I know

>Gonna drive and pick my squad from their home

>And I can already hear

>City's calling for me

>If you want us to party

>You know where to find me

[Pre-Chorus]

>I’m walking in the streets

>Vibing on this rhythm

>Need just one minute to meet

>We end up in our hub

>We just wanna have fun

>Til the sun's rising up

>Cause the music leads my soul

>And I don't need more

[Chorus]

>Dance dance

>I don't wanna sleep now

>This song echoes around

>Dance Dance

>I don't wanna sleep now

>This song's play-ing around

>D.A.N.C.E

>Move your body tonight

>D.A.N.C.E

>And it will last all night

[Post-Chorus]

>Dance dance dance dance

>And it will last all night

>Dance dance dance dance

>All night

[Verse 2]

>I have waited all my life

>To follow my heart

>Now I know I'm alright

>When I break all my rules

>And you can think I'm a fool

>Oh! way “fooler” than you

>But I am finally ready to live something new

[Pre-Chorus]

>And I'm living my dreams

>Guided by this rhythm

>Oh, I just want to share it

>And enjoy together

>We just wanna have fun

>Til the sun rising up

>Cause the music rocks our souls

>And we don't need more

[Chorus]

>Dance dance

>>I don't wanna sleep now

>This song echoes around

>Dance dance

>I don't wanna sleep now

>This song's play-ing around

>D.A.N.C.E

>Move your body tonight

>D.A.N.C.E

>And it will last all night

>D.A.N.C.E

>Move your body tonight

>D.A.N.C.E

>And it will last all night

[Post Chorus]
